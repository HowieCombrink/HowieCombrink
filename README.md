- 👋 Hi, I’m @HowieCombrink
- 👀 I’m interested in development and design, I come form a music backround and I still produce music at my studio, The Hit Lab, visit our site www.thehitlab.co.za.
I've been tourring the world for 17 years with bands and just decided during covid 19 that I would like to pivot and move into IT while running my studio to make 
income during my studies. I do have great music industry based app ideas but just need to develop the skills and grow the build..
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and react...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on challenges and skill building exercises to get practise and build my development skills...
- 📫 How to reach me ... You reach me at my email address Howie@thehitlab.co.za
